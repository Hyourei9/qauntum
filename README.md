# Quantum Learning with Qiskit

This repository contains code and resources for learning and experimenting with quantum computing using Qiskit.

## Project Structure
- `qiskit_learn.py`: Main Python script for quantum computing experiments and learning exercises.
- `q-env/`: Python virtual environment containing all dependencies.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Hyourei9/qauntum.git
   cd qauntum
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```powershell
   .\q-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   Qiskit and other required packages are already installed in the virtual environment. If needed, install additional packages using pip:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the main script to start experimenting:
```powershell
python qiskit_learn.py
```

## Requirements
